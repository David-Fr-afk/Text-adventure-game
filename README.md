# Text-adventure-game
A text based adventure game created using PYSIMPLEGUI

So this repository has 2 files, one that is simply the text game that can be run and played. The second the game implemented using PYSIMPLEGUI. The pysimplegui is incompleted. The story is pretty long, I do want to finish this eventually because it was one of my very first projects, just dont have time ATM.
